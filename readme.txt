This wordsearch program is able to read input from separate files, wordbank.txt and wordpuzzle.txt, and then perform
a searching algorithim using the information parsed from the files, before finally outputting the results in the
format of a JSON file. In creating this program, I used web references from www.w3schools.com extensibly to understand
and find new methods and functions to use and help me with this program as well as to get the correct syntax.
I utilized additional resources from the textbook https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ and from the class and content
of Professor Parasuraman.
